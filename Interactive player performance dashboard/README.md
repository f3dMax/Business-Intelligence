This project is an interactive Excel dashboard analyzing Tyrese Maxey’s points-per-game performance across multiple NBA seasons. The dashboard allows to explore how scoring output changes depending on game context, opponent quality, and selected time periods. All visuals update dynamically through slicers, enabling focused, scenario-based analysis rather than static reporting.

As shown in the screenshots, adjusting the date range highlights different stages of Maxey’s performance, with clear changes in average points per game across seasons. Narrowing the period isolates specific years and reveals performance growth or decline that is not visible when viewing the full dataset. Selecting only good teams lowers average scoring and shifts the distribution toward fewer high-scoring games, while including weaker teams results in higher averages and more frequent 30+ point performances.

The dashboard also demonstrates how performance varies based on game outcomes and location. Filtering for wins increases average points per game and shifts the scoring distribution toward higher ranges, while losses concentrate results in lower scoring bins. Home vs road selection further impacts the trends, with road games generally showing reduced scoring consistency. Together, these interactions illustrate how context and competition level directly affect player performance.
