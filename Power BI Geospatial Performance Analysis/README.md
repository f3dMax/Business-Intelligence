This Power BI report visualizes Tyrese Maxey’s scoring performance by game location using a map-based approach. Average points scored are aggregated by city and displayed geographically, allowing quick comparison of how scoring output varies depending on where games are played.

As shown in the report, each location marker represents the average points per game recorded in that city. When interacting with the map or filtering the data, the displayed averages update accordingly, revealing geographic patterns such as higher or lower scoring performance in specific regions or venues. A supporting table provides game-level detail, linking individual performances to their locations.

This project demonstrates the use of Power BI for geospatial analysis, aggregation logic, and interactive exploration of sports performance data, translating raw game statistics into spatial insights.
