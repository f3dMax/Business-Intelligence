This Excel dashboard presents a performance summary for Tyrese Maxey during the 2021–22 NBA season using a stoplight KPI design. The purpose of the dashboard is to compare current performance metrics against predefined targets and visually indicate whether each statistic is meeting expectations, slightly off target, or underperforming.

As shown in the screenshot, each statistic (points, rebounds, assists, blocks, fouls, and turnovers per game) displays target values, current values, and the difference, with stoplight indicators updating automatically based on performance. Green indicators show metrics that meet or exceed targets, yellow indicates marginal deviation, and red highlights underperformance. For example, points per game exceed the target and are marked positively, while blocks per game fall below the target and trigger a negative indicator.

The dashboard demonstrates how Excel can be used to build executive-style KPI reports, where performance is quickly interpreted without reading raw numbers. Although the dataset used is intentionally incomplete for instructional purposes, the dashboard structure illustrates how stoplight logic can be applied to real-world business or sports performance monitoring.
